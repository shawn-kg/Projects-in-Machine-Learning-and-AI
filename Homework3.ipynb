        "For this project I decided first to have my gradient descent to be optimized with RMSprop because I already set the learning rate to 0.01 and the momentum to 0.9. With those numbers it was already going to be a gradual descent to minimize the loss and I feel RMSprop can only help with that. I chose 32 for the batch size as well since I thought a small one would help with a gradual gradient descent. For an activation function I used relu within the hidden layers to prevent against a vanishing gradient since I did run the network for above 150 epochs. I did not use regularization for this however because I feel that there were few enough features to cause overfitting and the model did really well on all training, dev, and test sets. Since this data set only had 4 features I thought that I could go with a plain train, dev, test strategy to get good numbers and it did come out well as both errors were within decimal places of each other.
